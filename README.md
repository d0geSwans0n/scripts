# Scripts
Scripts to do all kinds of useful tasks, setup user profiles, desktop environments, etc.

List of scripts I want to do:

- setup VSCode
- setup KDE Plasma environment in Parrot Security OS
- setup PowerShell user profile (don't know how useful this will be beyond colour scheme haha)
- do some object management in AD
